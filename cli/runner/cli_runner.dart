/// Implementations of this interface are responsible for parsing and handling
/// CLI arguments, dispatching to appropriate commands, and executing

/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyRunner implements CliRunner {
///   @override
///   Future<void> run(List<String> args) async {
///     // handle CLI logic
///   }
/// }
/// ```
