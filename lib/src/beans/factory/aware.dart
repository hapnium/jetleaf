/// {@template aware}
/// A marker interface for JetLeaf framework lifecycle awareness.
///
/// This interface is used to signal that a class is "aware" of a specific
/// framework infrastructure component or context, such as environment,
/// bean factory, application context, or resource loader.
///
/// Implementing subinterfaces like `EnvironmentAware`, `BeanFactoryAware`,
/// or `ApplicationContextAware` allows JetLeaf to inject those components
/// automatically during context initialization.
///
/// This is inspired by Spring's Aware interfaces.
///
/// ### Example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyService implements EnvironmentAware {
///   late Environment environment;
///
///   @override
///   void setEnvironment(Environment env) {
///     environment = env;
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract interface class Aware {
  /// {@macro aware}
  const Aware();
