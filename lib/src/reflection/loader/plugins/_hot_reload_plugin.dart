/// {@template hot_reload_plugin}
/// Defines a plugin interface for handling class-level hot reload events
/// within the class loading system.
///
/// Implementations can listen for changes in loaded classes and
/// respond when a class is reloaded during runtime, such as reinitializing
/// state, refreshing caches, or applying updates to live objects.
///
/// This is useful for development-time class reloading or dynamic runtime systems.
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class HotReloadPlugin extends ClassLoaderPlugin {
  /// {@macro hot_reload_plugin}
  const HotReloadPlugin();

  /// Called when a class identified by [className] is reloaded.
  ///
  /// The [clazz] parameter provides the new class reference that replaced
  /// the previous one during the hot reload.
  ///
  /// This method should perform any necessary updates or cleanup, such as:
  /// - reinitializing cached instances
  /// - re-registering the class in a type registry
  /// - notifying listeners or hooks
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// void onClassReloaded(String className, Class<Object> clazz) {
  ///   print('Reloaded: $className with new class reference: $clazz');
  /// }
  /// ```
  void onClassReloaded(String className, Class<Object> clazz);
