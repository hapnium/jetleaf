/// {@template reflectable_annotation}
/// Base class for all reflectable annotations.
/// 
/// This class serves as the base for all annotations that can be discovered
/// and processed through the reflection system. It provides the basic
/// contract that all reflectable annotations must implement.
/// 
/// Unlike Dart's built-in Annotation class, this class is designed specifically
/// for use with the reflection framework and provides additional metadata
/// and processing capabilities.
/// 
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class ReflectableAnnotation {
  /// {@macro reflectable_annotation}
  const ReflectableAnnotation();
  
  /// Returns the annotation type of this annotation.
  /// 
  /// This method returns the runtime type of the annotation, which can be
  /// used for type checking and filtering operations.
  /// 
  /// **Returns:** The Class object representing the annotation type
  Type get annotationType;
  
  /// Checks if this annotation is equal to another object.
  /// 
  /// Two annotations are considered equal if they are of the same type
  /// and all their properties have equal values.

  /// - [other]: The object to compare with this annotation
  /// 
  /// **Returns:** true if the objects are equal, false otherwise
