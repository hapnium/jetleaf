/// {@template context_started_event}
/// Event published when the [ApplicationContext] is started or restarted.
///
/// This event indicates that the context is now active and ready to process
/// requests, initialize beans, or resume tasks that may have been paused or
/// stopped.
///
/// It is typically used after a call to `start()` or when a previously stopped
/// context is reactivated.
///
/// ---
///
/// ### Example:
/// ```dart
/// class StartupLogger implements ApplicationListener<ContextStartedEvent> {
///   @override
///   void onApplicationEvent(ContextStartedEvent event) {
///     print("Application context started: ${event.getSource()}");
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract class ContextStartedEvent extends ApplicationContextEvent {
  /// {@macro context_started_event}
  ContextStartedEvent(super.source);
